Create your own copy of the project on GitHub. You can do this by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner of the landing page of the repository.

where YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME is your GitHub handle.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/servers to access the API's to Put a server (data should be in the body of request) and Get all available servers.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/servers/{serverId} to Get a server with that particular ID .

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/servers/{serverName} to Get a server with that particular Name.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/servers/{serverId} with a DELETE method to delete a server with that particular ID.
